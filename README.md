# Tetris

This is the world-famous game Tetris created created by utilizing Pygame. It works like the real game except there are a few features that I still need to implement/left out (hold piece, hard drop with spacebar). While this project was fun to make,
I had learned mroe about different functions in Pygame as well as learning more about object-oriented programming (dealing with classes and objects)

Note: run this game, please ensure you the scores.txt file and main.py are in the same directory and ensure that you are in the directory when lauching the game. The game will not run if these steps aren't followed!
